0 that he intended to lead the column himself. Having ridden to the village
0 of Pratz, he halted. Prince Andrei, one of the enormous number of persons
0 constituting the commander in chief's suite, stood behind him. Prince Andrei
0 felt excited, irritated, and at the same time restrainedly calm, as a man usually
0 is when a long-desired moment comes. He was firmly convinced that this was the
0 day of his Toulon or his bridge of Arcole.[1] How it would happen,
0 he did not know, but he was firmly convinced that it would be so. The
0 locality and position of our troops were known to him, as far as they could be
0 known to anyone in our army. His own strategic plan, which there obviously could be no
0 thought of carrying out now, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother's plan, Prince
0 Andrei pondered the possible happenstances and came up with new considerations, such as
0 might call for his swiftness of reflection and decisiveness.
0 To the left below, in the fog, exchanges of fire between unseen troops could be heard.
0 There, it seemed to Prince Andrei, the battle would concentrate, there an obstacle would be
0 encountered, and "it's there that I'll be sent with a brigade or division, and there, with a
0 standard in my hand, I'll go forward and crush everything ahead of me."
0 Prince Andrei could not look with indifference at the standards of the battalions
0 going past him. Looking at a standard, he thought: maybe it is that very standard
0 with which I'll have to march at the head of the troops.
0 By morning the night's fog had left only hoarfrost turning into dew on the heights,
0 but in the hollows the fog still spread its milk-white sea. Nothing could be seen in
0 that hollow to the left, into which our troops had descended and from which came the
0 sounds of gunfire. Over the heights was a dark, clear sky, and to the right-the enormous
0 ball of the sun. Far ahead, on the other shore of the sea of fog, one could make out the
0 jutting, wooded hills on which the enemy army was supposed to be, and something was discernible.
0 To the right the guards were entering the region of the fog, with a sound of tramping and wheels
0 and an occasional gleam of bayonets; to the left, beyond the village, similar masses of cavalry
0 approached and disappeared into the sea of fog. In front and behind moved the infantry.
0 The commander in chief stood on the road out of the village, letting the troops pass by him.
0 Kutuzov seemed exhausted and irritable that morning. The infantry going past him halted without any
0 command, apparently because something ahead held them up.
0 But tell them, finally, to form into battalions and go around the village,
0 Kutuzov said angrily to a general who rode up. "Don't you understand, Your
0 Excellency, my dear sir, that to stretch out in a defile through village streets
0 is impossible when we're marching against an enemy?"
0 I intended to form them up outside the village, Your Excellency, said the general.
0 Kutuzov laughed biliously.
0 A fine sight you'd be, lining up in view of the enemy, a very fine sight!
0 The enemy's still far off, Your Excellency. According to the disposition . . .
0 The disposition! Kutuzov exclaimed biliously. "Who told you that? . . . Kindly do as you're ordered."
0 Yes, sir!
0 Mon cher, Nesvitsky said to Prince Andrei in a whisper, "le vieux est d'une humeur de chien."[2]
0 An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes on his hat rode up to Kutuzov and asked on
0 behalf of the emperor whether the fourth column had started into action.
0 Kutuzov turned away without answering him, and his gaze chanced to rest on Prince Andrei, who was standing
0 close by. Seeing Bolkonsky, Kutuzov softened the angry and caustic expression of his gaze, as if aware that
0 his adjutant was not to blame for what was going on. And, without answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonsky:
0 Allez voir, mon cher, si la troisi�me division a d�pass� le village. Dites-lui de s'arr�ter et d'attendre mes ordres.[3]
0 Prince Andrei had only just started when he stopped him.
0 Et demandez-lui si les tirailleurs sont post�s, he added. "Ce qu'ils font, ce qu'ils font!"[4]
0 he said to himself, still not answering the Austrian.
0 Prince Andrei galloped off to carry out his mission.
0 Overtaking all the advancing battalions, he stopped the third division and ascertained
0 that there was in fact no line of riflemen in front of our columns. The regimental commander of
0 the front regiment was very surprised by the order conveyed to him from the commander in chief
0 to send out riflemen. The regimental commander stood there in the full conviction that there
0 were more troops ahead of him, and that the enemy was no less than six miles away. In fact,
0 nothing could be seen ahead but empty terrain sloping away and covered with thick fog.
0 Having ordered on behalf of the commander in chief that the omission be rectified,
0 Prince Andrei galloped back. Kutuzov still stood in the same place and, his corpulent
0 body sagging over the saddle in old man's fashion, yawned deeply, closing his eyes. T
0 he troops were no longer moving, but stood at parade rest.
